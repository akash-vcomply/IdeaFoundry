# 🌱 Smart Urban Gardens

An IoT + ML project for optimizing rooftop and balcony gardening in urban environments.

## 🚀 Overview
Smart Urban Gardens leverages sensors, machine learning, and automation to help city dwellers grow healthy plants on rooftops and balconies. The system monitors environmental conditions, predicts plant needs, and automates watering and care for maximum yield and sustainability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly)

## 🏁 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Connect your IoT sensors
4. Run the prototype: `python prototype.py`
