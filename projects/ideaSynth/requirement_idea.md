## 🚀 Project Overview: **IdeaSynth**

> An AI-assisted platform to collect, manage, and auto-generate structured product ideas (like PRDs) with GPT-suggested tech stacks, ready-to-use prompts, and future prototype scaffolds.

## 🧠 What It Does

1. **Idea Collection**
    - Users submit innovative ideas via a simple UI (title, short description, optional tags).
    - Ideas are saved into a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).
2. **Short Description + Metadata**
    - GPT summarizes or rewrites idea titles and descriptions for clarity.
    - Adds metadata (e.g. tags, potential domains, priority level).
3. **Generate PRD / Product Doc**
    - One-click generation of a structured **Product Requirements Document**.
    - Includes: Objective, User Stories, Features, Wireframe Prompts, MVP scope, etc.
4. **Prompt Generation for Agents / GPT**
    - Creates rich prompts for agentic platforms (like GPTs, Sora, Cursor, Copilot).
    - Example: “Act as a product engineer. Given the following PRD, generate a working prototype scaffold in Next.js using Supabase.”
5. **Smart Tech Stack Suggestion**
    - GPT analyzes the idea and recommends the best-fit tech stack (based on scope, category, scale).
    - Saved with the idea entry in DB.
6. **Clickable Dashboard**
    - Click on any idea ➜ see a summary ➜ click “Generate PRD” or “Get Prompt”
    - Prompts can be copied and pasted into any LLM tool.

## 📄 Example Flow

1. **User Input:**
    - *"An app that helps solo founders manage tasks, investors, and marketing all in one place."*
2. **Saved Idea:**
    - GPT Summary: *"All-in-one toolkit for solo startup founders"*
    - Tags: `#productivity #founder #startup`
3. **Click Generate PRD → Output:**
    - Title: SoloFounder OS
    - Objective, Features, User Stories, MVP Plan, Metrics
    - Suggested Stack: `Next.js + Firebase + Stripe + Clerk + OpenAI`
4. **Prompt Generated:**
    
    ```
    Act as a full-stack product engineer. Based on this PRD for a solo-founder management app, generate a Next.js boilerplate with task tracking, basic auth, and a marketing dashboard. Include DB schema and basic folder structure...
    ```
